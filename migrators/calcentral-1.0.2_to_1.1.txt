MIGRATING 1.0.2 TO 1.1.0

1. Bump the size of this MySQL variable in my.cnf and restart mysqld_safe:

[mysql]
max_allowed_packet=20M

Otherwise 1.1 startup will fail in a big way.

2. While v1.0.2 is still running, delete /var to give the new search templates room to drop in

curl -u admin:admin -e http://localhost:8080 http://localhost:8080/var -F":operation=delete"
curl -u admin:admin -e http://localhost:8080 http://localhost:8080/var -F "jcr:primaryType"="sling:Folder"

Now stop v1.0.2 and update the code from Git.

3. Blow away some old sling directories:

mvn -e -Dsling.purge -P runner clean
rm -rf working/sling/solr

(Our Maven procedures take care of the OAE Confluence page's steps 3, 5, and 6.)

4. Run the database migration script:

myberkeley> mysql -u root nakamura < migrators/src/main/scripts/calcentral-mysql-1.0.2_to_1.1.sql

5. Update configurations and then start v1.1 over the same Sling directory. (We'll probably do this
via the usual "reinstall.sh".) DON'T ALLOW USERS ON YET!

6. Force a complete Solr re-indexing so that the database migration code can search successfully:

curl -u admin:admin -e http://localhost:8080 http://localhost:8080/system/console/solr -F type=all

Watch the server log for progress. On my laptop this took 35 minutes to finish.

7. Run /system/sparseupgrade to migrate data, move to the new Sparse indexing schema, and
re-re-index Solr:

curl -N -u admin:admin -e http://localhost:8080 -FdryRun=false -FreindexAll=true http://localhost:8080/system/sparseupgrade

The Sparse job took about 20 minutes. The Solr re-indexing takes the same amount of time as in
step 6.

You may see many "Counter cachedStatement Leaking" messages due to a Sparse bug:
