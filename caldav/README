Loading students into Bedework:

First we'll enable simple authentication in JBoss, which means you can log in as anyone by providing a username
and the same value as the password.

On the Bedework server, as Bedework user:
    cd ~/bedework/quickstart_3.7/jboss-5.1.0.GA/server/default/conf
    cp login-config.xml login-config.xml.orig
    cp login-config.unsecureLogin login-config.xml
    ~/killBedework.sh
    ~/startBedework.sh

Then doing an OPTIONS as each user is enough to make Bedework create its necessary rows for the user:

    curl -u 300849:testuser http://test.media.berkeley.edu:8080/ucaldav/principals/users/300849/ -X OPTIONS

If provided its optional 3rd and 4th arguments, the sling data loader script will do an OPTIONS request
for every user it loads. Example command line:

    sling_data_loader.rb http://localhost:8080/ admin test.media.berkeley.edu 8080

Once the sling data loader runs, reset the jboss login config to its original state:

    cd ~/bedework/quickstart_3.7/jboss-5.1.0.GA/server/default/conf
    cp login-config.xml.orig login-config.xml
    ~/killBedework.sh
    ~/startBedework.sh
