Loading students into Bedework:

Proposal is to create fake accounts in the LDAP system that ships with Bedework (ApacheDS) so that we can log in
as each user one time, which makes the user's rows in Bedework's MySQL database that are necessary.

First we'll enable simple authentication in JBoss, which means you can log in as anyone by providing a username
and the same value as the password.

On the Bedework server, as Bedework user:
    cd ~/bedework/quickstart_3.7/jboss-5.1.0.GA/server/default/conf
    cp login-config.xml login-config.xml.orig
    cp login-config.unsecureLogin login-config.xml
    ~/killBedework.sh
    ~/startBedework.sh

Then doing an OPTIONS as each user is enough to make Bedework create its necessary rows for the user:

    curl -u 300849:testuser http://test.media.berkeley.edu:8080/ucaldav/principals/users/300849/ -X OPTIONS

The sling data loader script does this for every user it loads.

Once the sling data loader runs, reset the jboss login config to its original state:

    cd ~/bedework/quickstart_3.7/jboss-5.1.0.GA/server/default/conf
    cp login-config.xml.orig login-config.xml
    ~/killBedework.sh
    ~/startBedework.sh
