In this module, by default, tests are skipped (because the tests are really integration tests
 and require a running Bedework server on test.media.berkeley.edu).

To run the tests in this module, do:

mvn -Dcaldav.skiptests=false test

Loading students into Bedework:

Proposal is to create fake accounts in the LDAP system that ships with Bedework (ApacheDS) so that we can log in
as each user one time, which makes the user's rows in Bedework's MySQL database that are necessary.

First we'll enable file-based authentication in JBoss.

~/quickstart_customizations/jboss-5.1.0.GA/server/default/conf/users.properties stores usernames and passwords.
Passwords are Base64-encoded MD5 hashes.

On the Bedework server, as Bedework user:
    cd ~/quickstart_customizations/jboss-5.1.0.GA/server/default/conf
    cp login-config.xml login-config.xml.orig
    cp login-config.fileBasedAuth login-config.xml
    cd ~/
    ./killBedework.sh
    ./buildBedework.sh
    ./startBedework.sh

Then doing an OPTIONS as each user is enough to make Bedework create its necessary rows for the user:

    curl -u 300849:testuser http://test.media.berkeley.edu:8080/ucaldav/principals/users/300849/ -X OPTIONS

Once the curl OPTIONS is run for all the students in the data load, reset the jboss login config to its original state:
    cd ~/quickstart_customizations/jboss-5.1.0.GA/server/default/conf
    cp login-config.xml.orig login-config.xml
    cd ~/
    ./killBedework.sh
    ./buildBedework.sh
    ./startBedework.sh
