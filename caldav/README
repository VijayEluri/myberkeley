In this module, by default, tests are skipped (because the tests are really integration tests
 and require a running Bedework server on test.media.berkeley.edu).

To run the tests in this module, do:

mvn -Dcaldav.skiptests=false test

==============================================================================

Loading students into Bedework:

Proposal is to create fake accounts in the LDAP system that ships with Bedework (ApacheDS) so that we can log in
as each user one time, which makes the user's rows in Bedework's MySQL database that are necessary.

Creating a fake user acct in ApacheDS on the Bedework server:
    cd /home/bedework/bedework/quickstart-3.7
    bedework/build/quickstart/linux/adduser 300849 Fake 300849 300849@mysite.edu testuser

Then doing an OPTIONS as that fake user is enough to make Bedework create its necessary rows for the user:
    curl -u 300849:testuser http://test.media.berkeley.edu:8080/ucaldav/principals/users/300849/ -X OPTIONS

Once these 2 commands are run for all the students in the data load, we'll reset ApacheDS's database to the Bedework
default, effectively making it impossible to authenticate as these fake users. How to reset is TBD.
